// Root of a polynomial by Newton's method

/*
 * Root of a polynomial by Newton's method
 *
 * With CADNA, one can see that 7 significant digits were lost (despite the apparent stability).
 * By using the symbolic debugger, one can see that, at the last iteration, the denominator is a no significant value (a computed zero) and that the last answer of the stopping criterion is not reliable.
 * CADNA allows to stop the algorithm when the subtraction x-y is no significant (there is no more information to compute at the next iteration).
 * In Newton's method, a division by a computed zero may suggest a double root. One can simplify the fraction.
 * When these two transformations are done, the code is stabilized and the results are obtained with the best accuraccy of the computer. The exact value of the root is X_sol = 3/7 = 0.428571428571428571....
